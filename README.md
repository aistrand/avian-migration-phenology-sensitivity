# Influence of species-level traits on the sensitivity of aerial insectivores' migration phenology to climate change

This repository contains code that was used to process all of the data for this study (eBird data, species-level trait data, temperature data from the North American Regional Reanalysis, also called NARR, etc.) and run models to estimate the migration phenology of ten species of aerial insectivores in a temporally and spatially explicit manner, the sensitivity of this migration phenology to climate change, and the influence of species-level traits on this sensitivity. scripts_to_run_jobs contains R scripts that were used to run models on the OSCER supercomputer, and notebooks (bayesian_approach, specifically) contains Jupyter notebooks that were used to run models to estimate sensitivity and the influence of species-level traits on sensitivity. one-off_r_scripts contains additional R scripts that were used to process eBird data.

The R scripts whose names start with a digit and a dash (in scripts_to_run_jobs) were adapted from scripts written by Casey Youngflesh (Youngflesh et al., 2021).
